# Type C2E-121
The Type C2E-121 Paraflex subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

# About Paraflex
The Type C2E-121 subwoofer is designed for 21" drivers with a High BL and a strong cone. The subwoofer uses a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, which was named **Paraflex** for easy naming. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions. 

# Working range
The Type C2E-121 shall have a dimension of 1200 x 600 x 900 mm (wxhxd) and its tuning is around 32Hz (Fb). It's working range is from 30hz up to 100hz. We encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for midrange and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
