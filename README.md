# Type R-121-MK1
The Type R-121-MK! Paraflex subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

## About Paraflex
The Type R-121 subwoofer is designed for 21" drivers with a High BL and a strong cone. This design is optimised for the HOQS 21" Ferrite F216C and N216C drivers,  18Sound 21NSLW5000 21" 4-Ohm driver, but other drivers may also be used, for example the 18Sound 21NLW9601 or B&C 21SW152 etc. There is also a Type-R design for 18" drivers available. The MK1 is the latest version of this design and has added improvements for the HTR and a flatter overal response. See measurement graphs for more information.

The subwoofer uses a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, which was named **Paraflex** for easy naming. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions. 

## Updates:
The latest MK1 revision include improvements on the High Tuned Resonator which improves response and total bandwidth and phase.

## Working range
The Type R-121 shall have a dimension of 1200 x 600 x 800 mm (wxhxd) and its tuning is around 31Hz (Fb). It's recomended working range shall be from 30hz up to 130hz. We encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for subwoofer and midrange frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
